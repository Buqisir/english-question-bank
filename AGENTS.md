# Agent Instructions

This repo builds the local-first English question bank workbench.

## Persistent Working Memory

- Use `kratos-memory` as the project-scoped working memory for this repo.
- At the start of non-trivial question-bank tasks, search relevant Kratos memory from this repo root, for example `kratos-memory search "reading difficulty reviewer"`.
- Save durable workflow decisions, recurring pitfalls, reviewer invocation preferences, and stable product rules to Kratos at the end of a task.
- Do not save API keys, secrets, full copyrighted passages, private student/person data, or large raw model outputs to Kratos.
- Keep Kratos project scope anchored to `/Users/huangxuewei/Projects/english-question-bank`; do not mix it with `Local Vaults` memory.

## Product Posture

- Treat this as a formal product project, not a note vault.
- Keep `Local Vaults` out of the application code path. The vault may provide ideas later, but V0 data and code live in this repo.
- Preserve the core model: `Source -> Passage -> Question Group -> Question -> Paper Set -> Export`.
- Prefer teacher-operable workflows over abstract completeness.
- V0 is local-first, single-user, no login, no cloud sync.
- Open Design is for visual prototyping only. Production code belongs under `app/`.

## Super Teacher Boundary

For teaching-domain decisions, preserve the Super Teacher judgment layer:

- Evidence and classroom usability before feature excitement.
- Passage-first, not isolated-question-first.
- AI suggestions require human confirmation.
- Student version hides answers and explanations.
- Teacher version includes answers and explanations for讲评.

## Browser Verification

- Do not use the Codex in-app browser for this project for now; it has been timing out on local UI checks.
- Use local Chrome/headless Playwright for UI smoke tests and screenshots.

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues and PRDs are tracked as local markdown files under `.scratch/`. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

Use the default local triage vocabulary: `needs-triage`, `needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, `wontfix`. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context project. Read `CONTEXT.md` and relevant ADRs under `docs/adr/` before changing product structure, domain model, tests, or architecture. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.
